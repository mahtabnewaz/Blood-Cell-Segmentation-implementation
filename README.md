# Blood-Cell-Segmentation-implementation

We have implemented the code of a research paper of Blood-Cell-Segmantation. We worked on kaggle with Tpu/T4 Gpu accelarator to run and implement the model. Initially faced some version dependency model and fixed accordingly. 
We have implemented total 8 models: 

1. U-net, implemnted by Mahtab Newaz

2. U-net++, implemnted by Mahtab Newaz

3. R2-unet, implemnted by Mahtab Newaz & Ramisa Lamya

4. Attention-unet,implemnted by Nujhat Raisa Arpa
 
5. Attention-R2-unet, implemnted by Nujhat Raisa Arpa

6. Ternausnet, implemnted by Ramisa Lamya

7. Watershed(Segmantion), implemented by Mazharul Islam Nibir

8. Otsu method(Segmentation) implemnted by Nujhat Raisa Arpa

9. Balanced Histogram Thresholding(BHT Segmentation) implemnted by Nujhat Raisa Arpa & Mahtab Newaz

10. Fully convolutional network (FCN) implemented by Mazharul Islam Nibir & Mahtab Newaz
