# Blood-Cell-Segmentation-implementation

We have implemented the code of a research paper of Blood-Cell-Segmantation. We worked on kaggle with Tpu/T4 Gpu accelarator to run and implement the model. Initially faced some version dependency model and fixed accordingly. 
We have implemented total 8 models: 

1. U-net, 

2. U-net++,

3. R2-unet,

4. Attention-unet,

5. Attention-R2-unet, 

6. Ternausnet, 

7. Watershed(Segmantion), 

8. Otsu method(segmentation)
